            <h2>Privacy Policy for Todolyfy</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Todolyfy! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome Extension. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible about the data we use to provide you with our service.</p>
            <h3>The Core Principle</h3>
            <p>Our core principle is to collect the absolute minimum amount of information necessary to make our extension functional. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
            <h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you use the Todolyfy extension, we collect only one type of data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task Content:</strong> The text of the to-do list items that you enter into the extension.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or any other personal data. We do not track your Browse activity or any other user activity.</p>
            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>The task content you provide is used for a single, specific purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Generate AI-Powered Subtasks:</strong> The text of your task is sent securely to our backend service, which uses the Google Gemini AI API to analyze the task. The AI then generates a relevant list of subtasks, which is sent back to the extension for you to see.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The text you provide is used "in-the-moment" to fulfill this request and is not stored, logged, or saved on our servers after the subtasks have been generated. It is not used for any other purpose, such as training AI models, marketing, or analytics.</p>
            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p>All of your created tasks and subtasks are stored locally on your own device using Chrome's built-in storage.sync API. This means your to-do list is private to you and is not stored on our servers.</p>
            <h3>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties, with the sole exception of the Google Gemini AI API, which is essential for the core functionality of the extension. Our use of this service is governed by Google's own strict privacy policies.</p>
            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
            <h3>Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.</p>
